\title{Extract R-squared from a ftmglm or ftmlm object}
\usage{
\S4method{rsq}{ftmglm}(object, select = NULL)

\S4method{rsq}{ftmlm}(object, select = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class ftmglm or ftmlm.}

\item{select}{(optional) A character string of variables or indices to use. If omitted,
all variables are used to compute R-squared.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the R-squared (for ftmlm) or pseudo-R-squared 
(for ftmglm) of the model. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating 
better model fit.
}
\description{
Extracts the R-squared value from a fitted ftmglm or ftmlm object.
This function provides a measure of how well the model explains the variability
of the response/outcome and updates based on the available variables.
}
\details{
When \code{select} is specified, only the selected variables are used to calculate 
R-squared.

For linear models (ftmlm objects), R-squared is calculated using:
\deqn{TSS = yty - n \times y\_mean^2}
\deqn{SSR = B^T X^T y - n \times y\_mean^2}
\deqn{R^2 = \frac{SSR}{TSS}}

Where:
\itemize{
  \item TSS = Total Sum of Squares
  \item SSR = Sum of Squares due to Regression
  \item yty = Sum of squared outcome values
  \item n = Number of observations
  \item y_mean = Mean of the outcome variable
  \item B = Model coefficients
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming ftmglmModel and ftmlmModel are pre-fitted model objects
# Calculate R-squared for a ftmglm model using all variables
r_squared_glm <- rsq(ftmglmModel)

# Calculate R-squared using specific variables from a ftmglm model
r_squared_glm_select <- rsq(ftmglmModel, select = c("var1", "var2"))

# Calculate R-squared for a ftmglm model using all variables
r_squared_lm <- rsq(ftmlmModel)

# Calculate R-squared using specific variables from a ftmlm model
r_squared_lm_select <- rsq(ftmlmModel, select = c("var1", "var2"))
}
