\title{Extract R-squared from a ftmglm or ftmlm object}
\usage{
\S4method{rsq}{ftmglm}(object, select = NULL, s = NULL)

\S4method{rsq}{ftmlm}(object, select = NULL, s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class ftmglm or ftmlm.}

\item{select}{(optional) A character string of variables or indices to use. If omitted,
all variables are used to compute R-squared.}

\item{s}{(optional) Ridge penalty to apply during reweighting. Default is 0, indicating no penalty.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the R-squared (for ftmlm) or pseudo-R-squared 
(for ftmglm) of the model. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating 
better model fit.
}
\description{
Extracts the R-squared value from a fitted ftmglm or ftmlm object.
This function provides a measure of how well the model explains the variability
of the response/outcome and updates based on the available variables.
}
\details{
When \code{select} is specified, only the selected variables are used to calculate 
R-squared.

For linear models (ftmlm objects), R-squared is calculated using:
\deqn{TSS = yty - n \times y\_mean^2}
\deqn{RSS = yty - 2 \times \beta^T \times Xty + \beta^T \times XtX \times \beta}
\deqn{R^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}}

Where:
\itemize{
  \item TSS = Total Sum of Squares
  \item RSS = Residual Sum of Squares
  \item yty = Sum of squared outcome values
  \item n = Number of observations
  \item y_mean = Mean of the outcome variable
  \item B = Model coefficients
}

When \code{s} is specified, a ridge penalty is applied while calculating R-squared.
The estimate of R-squared is no longer exact under this condition, but it still provides
a useful measure of model fit.
}
\note{
The use of a ridge penalty is not applicable to \code{ftmglm} models and will be ignored if specified.

# Assuming ftmglmModel and ftmlmModel are pre-fitted model objects
