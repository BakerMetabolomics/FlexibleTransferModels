\title{Extract Model Coefficients from a ftmglm or ftmlm object}
\usage{
\S4method{coef}{ftmglm}(object, select = NULL)

\S4method{coef}{ftmlm}(object, select = NULL, s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class inheriting from \code{ftmglm} or \code{ftmlm}.}

\item{select}{(optional) A character string of variables or indices to use. If omitted,
coefficients for all variables are returned.}

\item{s}{(optional) Ridge penalty to apply during reweighting. Default is 0, indicating no penalty.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of coefficients.
}
\description{
Extracts the beta coefficients from a \code{ftmglm} or
\code{ftmlm} model. Allows coefficients to be estimated using a given set of variables.
}
\details{
When \code{select} is specified, only the coefficients for the selected variables are calculated.

The ridge penalty parameter \code{s} is only applicable to \code{ftmlm} models.
}
\note{
The use of a ridge penalty is not applicable to \code{ftmglm} models and will be ignored if specified.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming ftmglmModel and ftmlmModel are pre-fitted model objects
# Extract all coefficients from a ftmglm model
coeffs_glm <- coef(ftmglmModel)

# Extract coefficients for specific variables from a ftmglm model
coeffs_glm_select <- coef(ftmglmModel, select = c("var1", "var2"))

# Extract all coefficients from a ftmlm model with a ridge penalty
coeffs_lm <- coef(ftmlmModel, s = 0.1)

# Extract coefficients for specific variables from a ftmlm model with no penalty
coeffs_lm_select <- coef(ftmlmModel, select = c("var1", "var2"))
