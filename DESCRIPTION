Description: Provides a flexible framework for the transfer of 'omics prediction models.
    This package enables users to adapt glm, lm, and glmnet models to the Flexible Transfer
    Models (FTM) framework. This allows models to be evaluated in datasets without exact
    overlap in the predictor variables, without loss in generalisability, re-optimization or 
    access to individual-level data.
    It leverages an innovative matrix-based approach to re-estimate model parameters (beta 
    coefficients) using both full and reduced sets of predictor variables, enhancing the 
    transferability of prediction models across different datasets.
